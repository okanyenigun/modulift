# Modulift

**Modulift** is a powerful and efficient Python package designed to help developers, data scientists, and researchers explore and discover Python packages on PyPI based on specific keywords, package names, or full-text search within package descriptions. With a comprehensive dataset of PyPI packages, Modulift allows you to find relevant libraries for your project needs, making it an invaluable tool for anyone looking to streamline package selection and integration.

## Key Features

- **Exact Package Name Search**: Retrieve detailed information on a specific package by name.
- **Keyword-Based Search**: Search packages by multiple keywords with flexible "or" and "and" logic to refine results.
- **Full-Text Description Search**: Locate packages by searching for specific phrases or content in their descriptions.
- **Markdown Output Option**: Print search results in Markdown format, ideal for documentation or presentations.

## Installation

Install Modulift via pip:

```bash
pip install modulift
```

## Usage

Modulift provides an easy-to-use API for searching and exploring Python packages. Here’s a quick guide on how to use its core features.

### 1. Search by Package Name

Retrieve detailed information for a specific package by name:

```python
import modulift as mf

result = mf.search_by_package_name("numpy")
print(result)
```

**Output**:

```python
{
    'package': 'numpy',
    'description': 'NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides powerful N-dimensional arrays, sophisticated mathematical functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.',
    'keywords': 'scientific computing, array, linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number generation, data processing, numerical analysis',
    'popularity': 5
}
```

For a different package:

```python
result = mf.search_by_package_name("nullsweep")
print(result)
```

**Output**:

```python
{
    'package': 'nullsweep',
    'description': 'NullSweep is a Python library designed for detecting and handling patterns of missing data in pandas DataFrames. It provides a simple API to identify global missing data patterns across the entire dataset, patterns related to specific features within the dataset, and to impute missing values using various strategies.',
    'keywords': 'missing data, data imputation, pandas, pattern detection, feature-specific patterns',
    'popularity': 4
}
```

Markdown Output
To display the result in Markdown format:

```python
result = mf.search_by_package_name("numpy", markdown=True)
```

**Package**: numpy

- **Description**: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides powerful N-dimensional arrays, sophisticated mathematical functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
- **Keywords**: scientific computing, array, linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number generation, data processing, numerical analysis
- **Popularity**: 5

### 2. Search by Keywords

Search for packages using one or more keywords. Modulift supports both "or" and "and" relations.

Single Keyword Search

```python
result = mf.search_by_keywords("data science")
print(len(result))
```

Output:

```python
3141  # Number of packages related to "data science"
```

Multi-Keyword Search with "and" Relation

```python
result = mf.search_by_keywords("data science", "machine learning", "deep learning", relation="and")
print(len(result))
```

Output:

```python
115  # Number of packages related to all three keywords
```

Limiting Results with Markdown Output

```python
result = mf.search_by_keywords("data science", "machine learning", "deep learning", relation="and", limit=3, markdown=True)
```
